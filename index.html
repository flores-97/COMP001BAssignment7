            <h3 class="q1">What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h3>
                <p>What aided me during theses eight weeks were the examples and visual learning aids. Being able to see what was being asked for the week's assignment was a great help.</p>

            <h3 class="q2">What would you change about the course?</h3>
                <p>If I were to add or change anything about the class it would be adding a follow along video showing how you create and complete the assignment like you do during
                    the class. I think it would be very helpful as some of the slides are a little hard to understand.</p>

            <h3 class="q3">Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course? </h3>
                <p>I do believe I learned what was described during the syllabus. I also think I learned more than I expected too. After this course I can visualize what I want to create better
                    and allows me to create what I want with better understanding.</p>

            <h3 class="q4">What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h3>
                <p>Learning about the grid was new to me. Until this course I could not comprehend how sections were separated. Using a grid seems to be the easiest way to create a section on a page in my
                    opinion. </p>
